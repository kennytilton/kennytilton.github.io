# Micropipeline Illustrator

You can try it [here](https://kennytilton.github.io/micropipeline/). Reading on before doing so will help.

## Origins
Micropipeline Illustrator (M/I) represents my poor, electronically untrained understanding of Figure 17 of Ivan Sutherland's Turing Award paper [Micropipelines](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=63532). They will make me write one, it seems, if you yobbos ever figure out [Cells](https://github.com/kennytilton/cells/wiki).

Not holding my breath. Where was I?
