# web-mx-quickstart

An interactive TL;DR dog fed highlight film for [Web/MX&trade;](https://github.com/kennytilton/web-mx#readme), where further documentation and examples will be found.

## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:
```bash
lein fig:build
```

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:
```bash
(js/alert "Am I connected?")
```
...and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:
```bash
lein clean
```
To create a production build run:
```bash
lein clean
lein fig:min
```
