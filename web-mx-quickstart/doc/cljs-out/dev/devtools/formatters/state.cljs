(ns devtools.formatters.state)

; - state management --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; we have to maintain some state:
; a) to prevent infinite recursion in some pathological cases (https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools/issues/2)
; b) to keep track of printed objects to visually signal circular data structures
;
; We dynamically bind *current-config* to the config passed from "outside" when entering calls to our API methods.
; Initially the state is empty, but we accumulate there a history of seen values when rendering individual values
; in depth-first traversal order. See alt-printer-impl where we re-bind *current-config* for each traversal level.
; But there is a catch. For larger data structures our printing methods usually do not print everything at once.
; We can include so called "object references" which are just placeholders which can be expanded later
; by DevTools UI (when user clicks a disclosure triangle).
; For proper continuation in rendering of those references we have to carry our existing state over.
; We use "config" feature of custom formatters system to pass current state to future API calls.
