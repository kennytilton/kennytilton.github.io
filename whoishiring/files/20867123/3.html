                  <span class="commtext c00">For anyone applying to the ML Engineer role.<p>I applied and interviewed for the ML Engineer position at Recursion a few months ago. The recruiter was very responsive and professional. Interacting with the recruiter was the only positive experience throughout the interview process. I interviewed with the Vice President of Engineering and Data Science. One was somewhat interested in my background&#x2F;projects, the other became frustrated as the interview progressed and ended the call after about 15 minutes. It was most likely because my familiarity with TensorFlow Extended (TFX) was basic. I was very disappointed because I really wanted to work at Recursion. I spent an enormous amount of time studying for this interview. In the end, it took me a few days to fully learn TFX, but Recursion is still looking for a ML Engineer two months later.<p>Some advice for anyone applying to the ML Engineer position. The position title is misleading. Recursion is looking for a _Senior_ ML Engineer. I met all the listed requirements and have three years of experience working with ML. That was not enough. Also, make sure to mention TensorFlow Extended (TFX). I&#x27;m pretty sure if you spend a day or two studying TFX, you&#x27;re considered a _Senior_ and can land the ML Engineer job.<p>Best of luck.</span>

We&#x27;re going to fix that, and we&#x27;d like you to help.<p>We&#x27;re a stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We&#x27;re well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.<p>Our team is composed of open-source enthusiasts, former audio&#x2F;DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going, fun-loving, dedicated folks.<p>About you:<p>- You know that product development goes off the rails without rapid, early feedback from real users.<p>- You believe that honesty and frequent, open communication are more signficant contributors to software development than technical wizardy.<p>- You believe that &quot;looks great&quot; does not necessarily equal &quot;feels great&quot;, and that the latter is higher priority (but your favorite applications accomplish both!).<p>- You want to build tools that help people help others in critical environments.<p>- You feel that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture. Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.<p>- You&#x27;re annoyed that modern websites ship megabytes of unnecessary dependencies to user&#x27;s browsers. You&#x27;re painfully aware of the difference between &quot;DRY&quot; as an important guiding principle of software development, and &quot;DRY&quot; as a cargo-cult mentality used to justify lazy over-coupling of code.<p>- You simultaneously hate and love Javascript, and are excited about various LLVM-based languages&#x27; recent progress targeting WebAssembly.<p>- You nerd out about content-specific adaptive streaming and compression techniques.<p>- You think Observable notebooks are really cool.<p>- You have a battle-tested workflow for debugging performance issues and deciding which layer of the stack merits optimization.<p>- From a front-end perspective, you recognize the tension in the development feedback loop between client-side software and a back-end service ecosystem, and derive immense satisfaction from improving development processes to relieve those tensions.<p>- You&#x27;re intimately familiar with the lifecycle of software components - from experiment, to prototype, to an incremental release schedule.<p>- You sigh at bullet-pointed job descriptions that try to prescribe visceral emotional reactions to technical opinions.<p>Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language, and are still experimenting with various parts of our tech stack.

                  <span class="commtext c00">Squarespace | Senior Machine Learning Engineer | Onsite |  New York City (West Village area)<p>Apply here! 
<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.squarespace.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;77247" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.squarespace.com&#x2F;careers&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;77247</a><p>The Squarespace Machine Learning team is growing! We source projects from all over the company, ranging from direct integrations of NLP &amp; computer vision into our products to behind-the-scenes services that improve efficiency in our customer help center. Our team prizes stakeholder-focused development of research and project deliverables while also taking time out for reading groups, conference attendance and Hack Week projects that pursue educational and research goals.<p>The ML team uses a Python-focused development stack with all the usual ML and data processing libraries. We have a framework for rapidly deploying our models behind lightweight Flask web applications in a managed Kubernetes environment and to thrive in our team you should enjoy the full range of backend engineering tasks that go along with this. You won&#x27;t be developing ML models in isolation, but instead demonstrating leadership and ownership over deployment strategies, architecture choices to solve cold-start problems, defining observability and monitoring strategies and working with stakeholders to define validation metrics that don&#x27;t merely represent statistical considerations like overfitting or precision &amp; recall but go further to develop holistic understanding of model success in a broader product development context.<p>We are seeking a senior machine learning engineer with a highly developed skill set in software engineering, architectural design and experience mentoring junior engineers and collaborating with multiple stakeholders to deliver projects. You should be skilled in the application of machine learning both on the statistics side and the backend engineering side and comfortable moving between the two sets of responsibilities as the situation demands. We welcome applicants with experience in any variety of machine learning or applied statistics context (e.g. quant finance, time series analysis, audio processing, etc.), though the candidate should show an enthusiasm for information retrieval, search and recommendation, and computer vision models because these are at the forefront of what we do.<p>Squarespace offers highly competitive compensation and exceptional benefits &amp; work life balance. In this role you can also expect a high degree of autonomy to help lead choices in ML technology investment and data set curation to set up Squarespace for future success. If this challenge sounds interesting to you, we&#x27;d love to hear from you so please apply!

                  <span class="commtext c73">[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers&#x2F;full-timers&#x2F;part-timers<p>Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we&#x27;re building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]<p>Job positions:<p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don&#x27;t already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and&#x2F;or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)<p>- C#&#x2F;.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.<p>- Rust developer: you dealt with C&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you&#x27;re still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You&#x27;re not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code&#x27;s API to be consumed by higher level languages.<p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You&#x27;re disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don&#x27;t look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.<p>- Desktop&#x2F;mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)<p>- SmartContracts&#x2F;blockchain developer: you&#x27;ve used&#x2F;developed smart contracts in languages Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble&#x2F;grin, DAI, etc<p>Important perk for all positions: all the code&#x2F;scripts you&#x27;ll write will be opensource, at least for the first 4months.<p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com<p>PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead&#x2F;managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.<p>PS II: I wouldn&#x27;t find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because rest is important).</span>
