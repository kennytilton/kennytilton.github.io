# Yet Another "Ask HN: Who Is Hiring" Browser
Here is the [live browser](https://kennytilton.github.io/whoishiring/)!

With luck, the HN listing browser interface will be easy to follow, but I look forward to clarifying things in response to user reports. Just raise an issue on the "home" [Matrix repo](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix).

Feature requests can be made there as well.

Some things I have in mind already:
* Simple: get some tooltips on the less obvious items.
* Huge: store user options so they persist across sessions.
* Use routing for options if storing options does not suffice
* Add a menu for selecting the month (and add more months)

Our goal is to make that great resource more accessible and at the same timw introduce the world to the joy of data flow programming.
